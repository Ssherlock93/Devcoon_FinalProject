=> handling for a single question/answer
-MVP with just one user, worry about other users later
-Logic that will check if the user's response === the correct answer, if it does, incremement user score, notify them of correct anser then advance to next question. If user response !== correct answer, then something like alert (sorry, wrong answer, better luck next time)

           What is a for loop?
intentionally stupid answer...
A for loop is an idea from golf, it's a loop that counts how many times 'Fore' is shouted on the golf course.
- counts to 4
