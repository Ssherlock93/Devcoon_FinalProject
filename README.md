## About the project (HERE)

(actual read me started above and out notes are below)

- PROBLEM DOMAIN
=> Who is this for, how should they expect to interact with it?
- As a user, I want to answer questions to help me better retain the information taught to me in the Code Fellows 201 bootcamp
- As a user, I want to become a kick ass developer
- As a user, I want to have the chance to choose the correct answer but if I guess wrong I want to have the correct answer pop up
- As a user, I wanty to see my high scores

=> What do we expect from this project, as developers?
- I want to take the users name and display it on the front page of the game
- I want to loop through a series of questions and compare the users selected choice to the actual answer
- Using local storage, I want to store the correct number of answers from the user
- I want to display the results of the quiz on the results page
- I want to create an about us page to highlight the devs that worked on this
- I have some stretch goals, such as: randomizing the order in which the answers appear each time the user goes through

=> handling for a single question/answer
-MVP with just one user, worry about other users later
-Logic that will check if the user's response === the correct answer, if it does, incremement user score, notify them of correct anser then advance to next question. If user response !== correct answer, then something like alert (sorry, wrong answer, better luck next time)

- class & ID names

Handle a single instance first...

           What is a for loop?
intentionally stupid answer...
A for loop is an idea from golf, it's a loop that counts how many times 'Fore' is shouted on the golf course.
- counts to 4
