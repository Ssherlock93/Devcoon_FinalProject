## About the project
Learning new information can be challenging.

Learning new information that is the equivalent to the drops of water that fall over the edge of Niagara Falls is overwhelming.We made an app to help!

We've created a quiz that allows users to practice some of the vocabulary and logic that they've been learning in the Code Fellows 201 bootcamp.

## Here's how we did it:
1. We set up our newly formed group by creating a "Team Agreement" with our work hours, break times, anger management plan, snack rotations, and team name.

2. We began the project with a brainstorming session to determine how we could incorporate the new skills that we had just learned in Scott Schmidt's Summer 201 bootcamp.

3. We decided to make a quiz that would use logic to check if a user's response === the correct answer, if it did, we would then increment the users score and advance to next question. If user response !== correct answer, the quiz would just advance to the next question.

4. Once the quiz is complete, the user will be sent to the results page and see their total correct answers followed by the questions that they need to continue studying.

5. We used HTML to build the scaffolding for the look of our site.

6. We used CSS to create an interactive "About Us" page, to add hidden easter eggs to our site, and to get our styles just right.

7. We used JavaScript to create the logic and local storage for the quiz.
