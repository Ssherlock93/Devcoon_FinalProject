# User stories

## Technical Requirements
* Generate a group of 10 random questions out of 20 that are prepared
* Do not repeat any questions
* Store the users answers using local storage
* Clear users answers so they can play again with a fresh start
* Use variable names, classes, and id's that have uniformity
* Work in individual branches
* Our "GIT GOD" (Sean) will work with all branch owners to merge to master

## App User
* As a user, I want to answer questions to help me better retain the information taught to me in the Code Fellows 201 bootcamp
* As a user, I want to become a kick ass developer
* As a user, I want to have the chance to choose the correct answer but if I guess wrong I want to have the correct answer pop up
* As a user, I wanty to see my high scores

## App Developer
* I want to take the users name and display it on the front page of the game
* I want to loop through a series of questions and compare the users selected choice to the actual answer
* Using local storage, I want to store the correct number of answers from the user
* I want to display the results of the quiz on the results page
* I want to create an about us page to highlight the devs that worked on this
* I have some stretch goals, such as: randomizing the order in which the answers appear each time the user goes through
